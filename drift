Subscription service
Add an API or UI capability to register the models for drift analysis
have configuration set for the model based on user needs. configuration includes frequency, model details like model and I/O parameters, training data and production data.
Agent Orchestrator
handles the agents effectively
identifies the process required by the user or the app and assigns an agent. (create an MCP server for this scenario)
effectively communicates between agents
Drift Detection Engine
gets the data from the data store about the models required to be checked for drift and sends the data required to the LLM.
compiles the data from the LLM response and provides some service to do smart check, deep check and casual check for drift.
casual checks with the input output parameters present the result to the LLM for decision.
smart check test the I/O data and production data currently present. driven through agent and LLM.
deep check checks the model thoroughly with all the data and use the LLM for model validations too. 
communicates with agent on the result of the drift
present the all the results to the data store through agents
Monitoring Services
monitors the drift activities for all the user groups and effectively communicates with agents if anything is wrong.
monitors MCP server.
monitor agents
monitor drift detection data.
Notification Service
notifies user group (clients) on detected drifts
notifies admin on the drifts checks
notifies and audits drift completion
Reporting and Analytics Services
provides analysis on the model and trends of the model execution with the data
provides drift detected analysis
generate reports
does analysis on improvement that can be added (feedback)
Dashboard
Used by the App manager to checks the logs and reports
This encapsulates notification, monitoring and reporting and shows the user on the model status

Technical Architecture

Subscription Service
API Authentication: Implement OAuth 2.0/JWT for secure access
Data Schema: Design schema for storing model metadata, thresholds, and versioning
Synchronization: Add webhook support for real-time configuration changes
Service Discovery: Implement for dynamic component registration (Model registration should be dynamic as each model has different capabilities)
Agent Orchestrator
Containerization: Deploy agents as Docker containers orchestrated via Kubernetes You may use either MCP or A2AP (my recommendation is A2A)
Message Queue: Implement Kafka/RabbitMQ for reliable agent communication
Circuit Breakers: Add fault tolerance patterns for agent failures
State Management: Include distributed state store (Redis/etcd) for agent coordination
Observability: Add OpenTelemetry instrumentation for agent tracing
Drift Detection Engine
Feature Store: Centralized repository for model features and statistics
Algorithms: Implement KL-divergence, PSI, JS-divergence, and statistical tests
LLM Integration: Define structured prompt templates with versioning
Caching Layer: Add Redis cache for frequent drift checks
Pipeline Architecture: Stream processing for real-time drift detection
Monitoring Services
Time-series Database: Implement InfluxDB/Prometheus for metrics storage
Alerting Rules: Define multi-level alert thresholds with auto-remediation
Log Aggregation: ELK/Grafana Loki stack for centralized logging
Health Checks: Implement readiness/liveness probes for all services
Notification Service
Multi-channel Support: Email, Teams, and webhook integrations
Delivery Guarantees: At-least-once delivery with idempotency
Template Engine: Customizable notification templates with variable substitution
Rate Limiting: Prevent notification storms during large-scale drift events
Reporting & Analytics Services
OLAP Capabilities: Cube-based analysis for multidimensional drift reporting
Data Warehouse: BigQuery integration for long-term analytics (this is not mandatory just kept here, add your own thought)
Visualization Libraries: D3.js, Plotly for interactive visualizations
Export Formats: PDF, Excel, CSV, and API-based data extraction
Dashboard
Frontend Framework: React with Material Design components
Real-time Updates: WebSocket/SSE for live dashboard refreshes
Role-based Access: Fine-grained permissions for different stakeholders
Embedded Analytics: Interactive charts with drill-down capabilities
Additional Components to Consider
Data Lake/Warehouse: For storing historical drift data and analysis
API Gateway: For unified access control and rate limiting
CI/CD Pipeline: Automated deployment and testing for all components
Security Layer: Data encryption, access controls, audit logging
Distributed Tracing: End-to-end request tracking across services
Model Registry: Integration with MLflow/MLOps tools for model versioning
Feedback Loop System: Automated retraining triggers based on drift detection
Cost Optimization: Resource scaling based on workload patterns
